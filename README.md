# Mergepatrol

Mergepatrol is a merge queue for GitHub. Add a label to a pull request, and Mergepatrol rebases it onto its base branch, waits for the required checks, and merges it.

When a rebase has conflicts, an agent resolves them. Claude is the default. A plain `git rebase` runs first, so the agent runs only on real conflicts.

Status: early. Not ready for use yet.

## Crates

| Crate | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | The queue and its state machine. Pure logic, no I/O |
| `github` | GitHub App auth, the REST and GraphQL calls, and publishing commits through the Git Data API |
| `git` | Local git: fetch, worktrees, rebase |
| `resolver` | The `Resolver` trait, and the Claude implementation |
| `executor` | Where a job's workspace and commands run |
| `store` | The `Store` trait, and SQLite |
| `web` | The HTTP server: JSON API and the dashboard |
| `mergepatrol` | The binary |
